# Project spec for "pov"

## Objective
Surprise my girlfriend with a marriage proposal.

### Context about the project
I promised I would propose in the presence of a horse. However my girlfriend is vegan and the only consensual horse is the one made of bits.

### Context about me
I'm a software engineer at Google, don't shy away about explaining stuff technically. Although I have experience with Web dev, I have only used internal frameworks to Google.

### Idea
Create a publicly available website with an animation made of little stars in a 3d space.
There will be an input box in the right corner of the screen, where the user can input the rotation coordinates in space and a Go! button. 
Once the user clicks "Go!", the view should slowly rotate from the current rotation angle to the input coordinates.
There will be a specific coordinate in which the image of right will appear.
Once the "ring coordinates" are inputted, the user clicks "Go!" and the view fully transitions to show the ring, show the message "Will you marry me?"

## Approach

2. Ask clarifying questions when unsure.
3. Write tests - readable, behaviour-driven, fast.
4. Minimize dependencies.
5. Prioritize simplicity.
6. Avoid financial costs - free hosting only.
